"Ultimate RAG Bootcamp Using Langchain,LangGraph",6696573,226242927,"Overall, the content is good. However, some complex topics lack in-depth explanations.

"Ultimate RAG Bootcamp Using Langchain,LangGraph",6696573,225965609,"I took this course to get a serious, end-to-end understanding of RAG systems and agentic workflows in the LangChain/LangGraph ecosystem, and in terms of technical depth and topic coverage it delivers a lot of value. It goes well beyond toy examples and explains core concepts like embeddings, vector stores, retrievers, chains, agents, and different architectures, and then shows how to actually implement them in code. If you already have decent Python skills, you come away with a much clearer mental model of how modern RAG and agent systems are structured and why certain design choices matter.

The tradeoff is that the course is dense and sometimes feels more like a deep technical workshop than a polished, streamlined tutorial: the pacing can be uneven, some notebooks and code paths feel a bit messy, and because the ecosystem evolves quickly, a few imports or APIs may need small adjustments. That said, for developers who want real technical depth and are willing to think, debug, and adapt along the way, this is a very strong course that genuinely builds your capability to design and implement RAG and agent-based systems.",4.5,2026-01-06T20:24:16-08:00,Viorel Mirea

"Ultimate RAG Bootcamp Using Langchain,LangGraph",6696573,224084445,"The course is comprehensive and goes through many useful topics. However, if you have a few years of experience you will get bored very easily. It is very repetitive and the instructors spends a lot of time on unnecessary coding copying and pasting it from chatGPT. I can also tell if you are an absolute beginner then you won't be able to follow because the instructor skips explaining many things. I play it on 2X and keep skipping some parts of the videos to skip the repetitions, while at the same time I have to go to search for some important topics which were brought up and not explained enough in the videos. Overall I would say it is a good course, but with some tuning and thorough preparation it could have been much better.",3.0,2025-12-14T05:47:02-08:00,Ayman Abdelwahed

Enjoyed the course and how its laid out logically into multiple sections increasing in complexity as we go down the line. Initially I felt the way code was being typed during the course in the session was a bit distracting. However, that style of teaching grew on me. I especially like how the concept was explained first before jumping into coding and feel that concept + coding was very appropriate to not just be stuck in concept presentation but also forces you to be hands on.

"Ultimate RAG Bootcamp Using Langchain,LangGraph",6696573,217443397,"The course is amazing till now as I am from automation testing background without any ML/NLP knowledge. But I have good understanding of python. When learning this course I am able to understand the things easily specially why we are doing the things. There are some terms I have to search externally like sparse matrix and all but that is also understandable if u have python knowledge. I have read the comments that there is too much repetitions but I think that is required for this course also that helps for revision as well. The only problem I face when we use different techniques to implement same thing e.g prompt is written in too many ways somewhere it has lambda functions somewhere retriever and query passed(during chain creation) directly in that case I have to go back to see the differences, it would be better if that is also explained why a particular type of prompt is  used at that time. But still course is great. You must have good Python knowledge and little ML knowledge but I think even if you don't have ML/NLP knowledge still you can proceed and see the things the same time when using it e.g. cosine similarity, TF-IDF e.t.c. I hope after completing this course I can change my career in LLM testing or may be in RAG development",5.0,2025-09-27T00:58:28-07:00,Shubham Pandey

"Ultimate RAG Bootcamp Using Langchain,LangGraph",6696573,214587679,"Content is good but delivery of the knowledge could have been simpler and engaging.
Also, I think if the phrases/ words like ""go ahead"", ""at the end of the day"", ""specifically"" were used way too unnecessarily thereby disrupted the flow of absorbing the knowledge being imparted and elongated the training duration.

Lastly, to reinforce the knowledge being transitioned it is suggested to use context specific vocabulary. Example: instead of saying ""I'll write this pass that"" better to say ""I'll call this method and pass string as an argument"".

Another example:
Chapter 30, around 13:30 the trainer says ""...have my another thing..""? The biggest improvement that the trainer must bring in to use technical and contextual vocabulary.

Possibly, a better statement was, ""I'll call XYZ method or AIMessage class"", which is more relatable and technically aligned than saying, ""...have my another thing that is called AIMessage"".",3.0,2025-08-25T22:19:33-07:00,Abhishek Pandey

"Ultimate RAG Bootcamp Using Langchain,LangGraph",6696573,214491097,"The course gives a decent introduction to RAG, but I felt it could have been much better with more practical depth. Most examples are based on very small toy documents instead of real-world datasets, which limits the learning experience.

Another issue is that several sections seemed to reuse content from the his other courses (like LangGraph), sometimes even repeating the same concepts. This makes the course feel a bit recycled rather than a fresh, dedicated RAG course.

If you’re completely new to the topic, you’ll still get value from the explanations.",3.0,2025-08-25T00:10:24-07:00,Saon Paul
