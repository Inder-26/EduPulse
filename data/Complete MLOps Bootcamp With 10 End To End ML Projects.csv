Complete MLOps Bootcamp With 10+ End To End ML Projects,6185965,196909789,"The Good:

You will walk out of this course with some really fantastic code.  I was particularly interested in the MLOps with ETL pipeline section - I was able to take the code that we made there and create a base repo for my future work after I renamed the package and centralized a few more settings.   I also got everything up and running in a self-hosted environment.  
Also, the instructor takes a lot of time to try to explain what he is doing.

The Not as Good

As others have noted, the instructor has some bad habits when it comes to verbal crutches.  For example, he probably has a habit of probably saying probably more times then he probably needs to.  
More importantly, while the instructor spends a lot of time talking about what we are working on, at times it is more of a code walkthrough.   For example the ETL / MLOps section is almost 8 hours, and it didn't need to be that long.  I get that there is a TON of great code to get to - it just seemed like there would have been more to deliver the lessons.   Also, some things (like setting up a project in github) didn't need to be covered over and over again.  The student can't always assume that they can skip those chapters because there might be something new buried in the 20 minute lesson (I found that out the hard way).  

Overall, I am very happy with what I got out of the course.",4.5,2025-02-04T10:50:24-08:00,Adam Morgan

There are certain aspects that I would consider before enrolling in this course. Not a single question I have asked since starting this course has been answered by the instructor (I started in November 2024 and it is June 2025). This was the main reason I decided to take this course.
The instructor knows what he is doing and has a lot of knowledge but on some chapters it is almost as if you are reading the code by yourself. Some things are confusing, so I decided to ask questions but no one has answered them so far. Be warned about this.
Also there are parts of this course where the teacher says that he already explained some things, but they have not been explained. They must have to be from other of his courses because some things are not shown, especially on the Generative AI part.
Another minor inconvenience is that some files used in this course are not provided with a direct link via Udemy. I had to search them by myself on the instructor's repositories and since some file names had been modified it took more time than what I was expecting.

It would be better if the instructor at least gave the specific video link reference for the topics where he says that that was already covered. That way this would be more integrated and not feel as incomplete.",3.5,2025-01-20T13:33:12-08:00,Luis B

Complete MLOps Bootcamp With 10+ End To End ML Projects,6185965,191679405,"People who got this course at the beginning of their ML journey have no idea how lucky they are. Courses like this are so rare, here you get simple overview what ML engineering is all about in the REAL WORLD. Most of the courses focus on very low level stuff, go in depth of single topic what is huge overkill for most of the use cases at companies. Companies usually need simple but complete solution. No one cares if you can do CNN object detection model but only in Google Colab. This course will save you a lot of time, you won't be asking ""how I actually do this, do that"", here you have all you need to start working as ML. In fact this course should be first one you do right after understanding Python basics and libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit, tensorflow (sequential model only) if you want to become MLE fast.",5.0,2024-12-04T15:34:03-08:00,Adrian Kazi

Complete MLOps Bootcamp With 10+ End To End ML Projects,6185965,190935955,"1. I have posted 5 questions and I did not get a response on any of them (still stuck on an issue). The community is not engaging, and the instructor does not care now that about a month has passed since the course was launched. I've spent a lot of time googling, finding answers online, or just fixing it by myself; if some of the things had been explained clearly in the tutorials, that would have saved me a lot of hours.

2. There are some videos talking about a subject that was never explained, like ""list comprehension"" and ""using databases"" in the Python section. And ""docker volumes"" in the docker section. This is because the instructor has just reused the material from his other bootcamp course or Youtube and forgot to add those videos here. Same for the section on GitHub; those videos are already available on his YouTube channel.

3. If Python is a prerequisite for this course, why do we have 11 hours of Python material in it?

4. It also says basic familiarity with ML algorithms is also a prerequisite, but in the ANN project the instructor mentions that deep learning is also a prerequisite. As a result, it was very difficult to follow along with the code and the instructor did not explained anything about ANNs like he did with Python.",2.5,2024-11-26T12:37:21-08:00,Muhammad Zahid
